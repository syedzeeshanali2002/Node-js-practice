# Node-js-practice

1) NodeJS is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. 
2) JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely supported across all major operating systems.
3) Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. They act as named containers for information that can be used and modified throughout a program. Before using a variable, it needs to be declared using one of the following keywords: var, let, or const.
4) var :
         are function-scoped or globally-scoped, and can be redeclared and reassigned. Due to its behavior, it can sometimes lead to unexpected issues, so it is less commonly used in modern JavaScript.
6) let:
       Variables declared with let are block-scoped and can be reassigned, but not redeclared within the same scope.
7)const:
   Variables declared with const are also block-scoped and cannot be reassigned after their initial declaration. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the contents of the object or array can still be modified.
